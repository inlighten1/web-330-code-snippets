## Course Description

Master JavaScript by learning and writing real-world applications.  This course examines intermediate and advanced JavaScript concepts and techniques.
Topics includ advanced functions, asynchronous executions, jQuery design patterns, MVC (Model-View-Controller) with Backbone.js, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Knockout.js, and single-page applications.  Projects utilize these topics in an intensive, hands-on style format to build enterprise level solutions.  GitHub is used for collaboration and sharing of individual and group projects. 

Prerequisite: WEB 230/231

## Repository Overview 

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.  

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code so you can visually see the concept "in action."  Assignments are broken into "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.  

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.
